    "## Empirical Exercise 2: The Great Recession in Real Time and Today\n",
    "\n",
    "Before President Obama took office in January 2009, the U.S. had already entered a deep recession. In response, his economic advisors developed a $787 billion stimulus package—**the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)**—intended to reduce the severity and duration of the downturn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, two key economic advisors, [argued that ARRA](https://www.ampo.org/assets/library/184_obama.pdf) would save three to four million jobs and prevent the unemployment rate from exceeding 8 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, that forecast proved to be overly optimistic. The unemployment rate surged to 10 percent, and **6.5 million more Americans lost their jobs than anticipated**. Their underestimation of the recession’s depth—and failure to advocate for a larger stimulus—prolonged the economic slump and sparked political disagreements that persist today. This misstep became a critical lesson, leading to a much more aggressive response to the COVID-19 recession.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why did Romer, Bernstein, and the broader economic community get it so wrong?*  \n",
    "One hypothesis: they relied on **flawed real-time data** that failed to reflect the true scale of the crisis.\n",

    "To account for this, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Create an index* for each data series that shows the cumulative percent change in real GDP since 2007:Q1.\n",
    "- Your graph should:\n",
    "  - Use '\"Quarters since January 2007\"' on the x-axis,\n",
    "  - And '\"Cumulative percent change in real GDP\"' on the y-axis.\n",
